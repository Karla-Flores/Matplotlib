Study Results

1 - Capomulin and Ramicane have positive results in reducing the tumor volume in 45 days. Capomulin maintains the highest survival rate in further analysis and reduces the tumor volume, which is the lowest (36.67 mm3) between the best regiments.

2 - Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Placebo, Propriva, Stelasyn, and Zoniferol did not have good treatment results because mice tumor volume increased during the study. Those drugs have the standard deviation of over 6.62.

3 - There is a positive correlation between the Tumor volume and the weight of the mice; the heavier the mice, the larger the tumor.
