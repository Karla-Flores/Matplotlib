Study Results

1 - Capomulin and Ramicane have positive results in reducing the tumor volume in 45 days. Capomulin maintains the highest survival rate in further analysis and reduces the tumor volume, which is the lowest (36.67 mm3) between the best regiments.

Capomulin Regimen
Average Tumor Volume (mm3) for Capomulin is: 36.67
Median Tumor Volume (mm3) for Capomulin is: 38.13
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) IQR for Capomulin is: 7.78
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) for Capomulin below 20.7 could be outliers.
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) for Capomulin below 51.83 could be outliers.
Number of outliers for Capomulin is: 0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramicane Regimen
Average Tumor Volume (mm3) for Ramicane is: 36.19
Median Tumor Volume (mm3) for Ramicane is: 36.56
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) IQR for Ramicane is: 9.1
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) for Ramicane below 17.91 could be outliers.
Final Tumor Volume (mm3) for Ramicane below 54.31 could be outliers.
Number of outliers for Ramicane is: 0

2 - Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Placebo, Propriva, Stelasyn, and Zoniferol did not have good treatment results because mice tumor volume increased during the study. Those drugs have the standard deviation of over 6.62.




3 - There is a positive correlation between the Tumor volume and the weight of the mice; the heavier the mice, the larger the tumor.
