Study Results

1 - Capomulin and Ramicane have postive results on reducing the tumor volume in 45 days. In further analysis, Capomulin maintains the highest survival rate and a reduction in the tumor volume.


2 - Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Placebo, Propriva, Stelasyn and Zoniferol did not have good treatment results because mice tumor volume increased during the study.

3 - There is a positive correlation between the Tumor volume and the weight of the mice, the heavier the mice the larger the tumor.
